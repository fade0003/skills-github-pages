# 🇺🇸 Honoring Veterans with Tech and Time

Today at **Rentech Labs**, we pause to honor the service and sacrifice of our nation’s veterans.  
Whether you're a fellow dad who served, someone raising future servicemen and women, or simply a citizen who values freedom — **Veterans Day matters**.

## 💬 A Personal Note

As a father, I think about legacy often. What am I building? What values am I passing on? Veterans remind us that service, commitment, and courage aren’t just ideals — they’re choices made daily, often at great personal cost.

## 🔧 Tech That Helps Veterans

On this day, I wanted to spotlight a few ways **technology is making life better for veterans**:

- **🦾 Smart prosthetics**: Innovations in adaptive tech are giving wounded veterans more mobility than ever before.
- **📲 VA Health Apps**: Mobile platforms like *VA Health Chat* and *Annie* are connecting veterans to care quickly and confidentially.
- **🧠 Mental Health Tools**: Apps like *PTSD Coach* and *Headspace* (free for veterans!) support mental wellness post-deployment.

👉 Want to help? Donate old tech to programs like [Computers for Veterans and Students](https://www.cvasusa.org/).

## 👨‍👧‍👦 Dad Life Perspective: Teaching Through Service

Today’s a great day to talk to your kids about **why we observe Veterans Day**.  
Here are a few things we did at our house:

- Built a LEGO flag together 🇺🇸  
- Watched a short documentary on military families  
- Wrote a thank-you letter to a neighbor who served  

It doesn’t have to be big — just intentional.

## 🎖️ Thank You

To all who have served: **Thank you**.  
Your bravery makes it possible for dads like me to teach, build, and dream in peace.

Happy Veterans Day from Rentech Labs.
